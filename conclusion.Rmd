# Discussion and Conclusion {#discussionandconclusion}

We achieve stationarity by a -- to our knowledge -- not yet described transformation in the literature with very satisfying results on our dataset. Our results support the assumption that a transformed tree ring time series can be reasonalbly described by an ARMA(1,1) process. Furthermore, we show that an ARMA(1,1) process can also be helpful to impute missing values. In particular, we give some evidence that the approach based on an ARMA(1,1) process outperfoms simple linear interpolation on the original time series.

In our analysis, the shape of the trend which we use to achieve stationary is not explained by exogenous variables. However, the growth of trees is likely influenced by many factors as for example the climate, soil, slope, exposition, forest cultivation, sun activity (11-year cycle) and others, and it could be very interesting to learn more about these relationships, also with respect to imputing missing values. A preliminary analysis based on an ARMA model with exogeneous variables^[Such models are also called ARMAX in the literature.] from the U.S. National Oceanographic and Athmosperic Administration (NOAA) for Arizona and Arizonian tree ring data from R-package `dplr` has shown the potential usefulness of such an approach. An unsolvable problem is however the very limited data availability since climatic data were not (systematically) collected before 1895.
