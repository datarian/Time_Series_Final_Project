# Introduction

Dendrochronology is an archaeological method for dating artifacts (other uses are i.e. radiocarbon calibration, geomorphological dating, dendroclimatology, ...). Chronologies are constructed by measuring the patterns of tree ring widths from individual wooden artifacts, then overlaying the data to build up a continuous series of yearly mean ring widths spanning hundreds to thousands of years. Newly measured artifacts are matched to existing, dated chronologies serving the double purpose of strengthening the chronology and dating the artifact in question. Chronologies are generally constructed for defined geographical regions as the environment (i.e the local climate, soil properties and terrain) has substantial impact on the growth of trees [@baillie2012slice].

## Dating buildings through dendrochronology

The chronology used for this project has been compiled from 234 individual measurements of buildings in the Bernese Oberland which are all located above 900 meters. Typically, the wooden structure of old buildings is sampled by boring the beams. The drilling core is then analyzed by microscoping, recording the sequence of tree ring widths. Spruce was a common building material and there is a wealth of houses supplying data. The data can be assumed to originate almost entirely from trees that grew above 900 meters since trees were rarely transported uphill. The data has been supplied by the archaeological service of the canton Berne [@dendroBern] through a personal contact at the dendrology laboratory in Sutz, BE who also detailed the process of acquiring the samples.

## Time series analysis and dendrochronologies

Literature states a few common time series processes that fit many dendrochronologies. Interestingly, for series less than 200 years long, ${AR}(1)$ has been identified as the predominant trend while ${ARMA}(1,1)$ better fits longer series [@woollons1990time], [@FOX2001261]. Other sources [@dplR] name ${AR}(2)$ as a frequently obtained process.

We have decided to focus on these three processes throughout the analysis.

## Scope of this report

The project team investigated several approaches to obtain a stationary time series. Once this was achieved, we fitted the most likely processes mentioned above and compared three different imputation approaches in terms of best prediction of randomly selected missing values in the series.

Furthermore, we investigated how exogeneous data could be employed to achieve a stationary time series. This investigation was done on a separate time series contained in the R-package 'dplR' [@dplR] and using climatic data originating from the U.S. National Oceanographic and Athmosperic Administration.
