# Introduction

Dendrochronology is an archaeological method used for dating artifacts. Chronologies are constructed by measuring the patterns of tree ring widths from individual wooden artifacts, then overlaying the data to build up a continuous series of mean yearly ring widths spanning hundreds to thousands of years. Chronologies are generally constructed for defined geographical regions as the environment (i.e the local climate, soil properties and terrain) has substantial impact on the growth of trees.

Newly measured artifacts are matched to existing, dated chronologies serving the double purpose of strengthening the chronology and dating the artifact in question.

## Dating buildings through dendrochronology

The chronology used for this project has been compiled from 234 individual measurements of buildings in the Bernese Oberland which are all located above 900 meters. Typically, the wooden structure of old buildings is sampled by boring the beams. The drilling core is then analyzed by microscoping, recording the sequence of tree ring widths. Spruce was a common building material and there is a wealth of houses supplying data. The data can be assumed to originate almost entirely from trees that grew above 900 meters since trees were rarely transported uphill. The data has been supplied by the archaeological service of the canton Berne [@dendroBern] through a personal contact at the dendrology laboratory in Sutz, BE.

## Timeseries analysis applied to dendrochronologies

- WOOLLONS: Usually ARMA1,1 / AR1 processes

- dplR: AR2

- We will look at AR1, ARMA1,1 more closely
