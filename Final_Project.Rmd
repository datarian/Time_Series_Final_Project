abstract: "A dendrochronology compiled using samples taken from wooden buildings in the Bernese Oberland was investigated using methods of time series analysis. A stationary series was obtained through a combination of scaling, log-transformation and linear trend removal. Several possible models were identified, both from literature clues and the graphical interpretation of the data. For these models, the performance of 4 imputation strategies was investigated and the results compared. It could be demonstrated that state-space approaches were superior to simple linear interpolation."
